Hi, I am Sourabh Chakraborty
Currently working in the Tsystems, as a consultent from past 2 yrs. total expriance is 7+ years
Come to the professional skills I have worked on Selenium(java) & UFT using maven ,github, testng and jenkins.

From project side
1. So currently we are 4 members in the team. I am leading all of them.
2. Currently working on HASP(Hybrid application service platform). In which we order service from SNOW and track the application till it deploy in our system.
3. In which it will go to multiple applications like SNOW-->Gitlab-->Consul-->vcenter-->Promuthus-->SNOW and we have to track the status.
4. Currently we got requiredment from client then we will create manual test cases & verify test data scope with ASO.
5. We perform manual e2e testing then automation started for those requiredment. 
6. For automation we are using selenium webdriver(java) and we created the                                              	framework from strach.
7. We use github for version control and jenkins for shedules the task and bat file to run the test without IDE.

Chanllenges in project :
1. Manage the multiple work at a same time.
2. Manage with other team to test e2e testing for discovery.
3. Discussion with ASO regarding the issue in the product.

Chanllenges in automation :
1. Dynamic xpath.
2. Dynamic wait.
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver,10);
wait.util(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.xpath()));
